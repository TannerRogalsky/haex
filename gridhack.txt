1. ABOUT


Gridhack is an IRC game coded by Fraxtil. It is a derivative of a game called
Cyberzone, created by blue_tetris and coded by thecalcgenius.


2. QUICK START


This is a brief overview of how to play the game, intended for newcomers.

All players are on a virtual two-dimensional grid. Rows are marked by letters
and columns by numbers, like Battleship. You know your own location, everything
that is in your row, and everything that is in your column. When it's your turn,
you can move across your row or column as far as you want, like a rook in chess.
When you move, your previous location becomes a hole in the grid. If any player
falls through a hole, they lose the game. If player 1 moves into the same
location as player 2, player 2 is "hacked" and loses the game. Therefore the
objective of the game is to avoid falling through holes and to hack your rivals.

Sometimes "programs" are placed on the grid. Programs are usually helpful, but
sometimes can be dangerous. Pursue them at your own risk and read section 7 for
more information on them.


3. TERMINOLOGY


People:
  Hacker	Any player. Usually refers to the player whose turn it is.
  Rival		Any player other than the one whose turn it is.
  Initializer	The player who started the game.
  SysOp		The (fictitious) overseer of the Grid who looks out for Hackers.

Things:
  Grid		The playing field.
  Program	A hacking device on the Grid.
  Flag		An attribute of a Program that modifies its behavior.
  Shell		The Hacker's private interface (their query with the bot).
  Chatroom	The public interface (the channel where the bot resides).

Actions:
  Jack In	Connect to the Grid.
  Hacked	Disconnected from the Grid by a Hacker.
  Ejected	Disconnected from the Grid by the SysOp.
  announce	Send to the Chatroom.
  reveal	Send from the bot to a Hacker's Shell.
  input		Send from a Hacker to the bot (via their Shell, obviously).
  

Grid terms:
  location	A row-column pair. A1 represents the first row's first column.
  coordinate	Either the row (letter) or column (number) of a location.
  view		All locations that are in either of a Hacker's coordinates -
		that is, all locations that a Hacker can see on their turn.
  hole		A location that has been visited by a Hacker.
  space		A location that is not a hole.
  free space	A space that is not occupied by a Hacker.
  empty space	A free space that does not contain a Program.


4. RULES


Any user in the Chatroom can start a game by announcing "gridhack". That user is
automatically Jacked In and becomes the Initializer. Other users may Jack In by
announcing "jack". While users are joining the game, the Initializer must
configure the game via the method described in the following section. Once all
users who wish to play are Jacked In, the Initializer must announce "done". The
Initializer can also announce "reset" at any time to halt the game.

Each Hacker is instructed to input "load" to confirm their presence. Once all
Hackers have done this, the actual game will begin. Each Hacker is placed on a
random location on the Grid, as well as any programs configured to be preloaded
via the configuration option "preload grid". Each Hacker is also given any
Programs listed in "preload hackers". Hackers are then randomly sorted by the
bot and will take turns sequentially.

At the beginning of a Hacker's turn, the bot will reveal to them their current
location, the number of holes in each of their own coordinates, and any Rivals
or Programs in those coordinates. Program names are surrounded by brackets and
Rival names are surrounded by parentheses. Some examples:
  Your location is C5. 2 holes and (Bob) are in row C. 1 hole, [ESC], and
    (Alice) are in column 5.
  Your location is A1. Nothing in row A. [Peekaboo], [Timewarp], and (Joe) are
    in column 1.
  Your location is F10. Nothing in row F or column 10.
The Hacker is also instructed to choose a row or column to move into; if they
choose to move into a different row, their column is preserved, and vice-versa.
That means that a player in B2 can move into A2, C2, D2... and B1, B3, B4... but
not A1, C5, F10, etc.

If the Hacker moves into a hole, they are exposed to the SysOp who will
immediately Eject them from the Grid. Their location and loss are announced. If
the Hacker moves into a space occupied by a Rival, that Rival is Hacked, and
their location and loss are announced (thus revealing the Hacker's location). If
the Hacker moves into a space occupied by a Program, the acquisition is
announced, but not the location. Most Programs require immediate input from the
Hacker and will be used and deleted after this input is given. Some programs are
kept by the Hacker indefinitely, or until used during a turn. Programs with the
flag ONDEM can be activated during the Hacker's turn if they input the program's
name instead of a location.

After the Hacker has made their move, the space which they previously occupied
is changed to a hole. The next Hacker must then take their turn. Once there is
only one Hacker remaining on the Grid, that Hacker has achieved eliteness and
wins the game.


5. CONFIGURING GRIDHACK


The Initializer will have to configure the game by announcing "config Option
Value" for each Option until they are satisfied with the configuration. When
they are done and anybody who wishes to play is Jacked In, they must announce
"done". Below are the available Options and their acceptable Values.

size
  Changes the size of the Grid.
  Value: XxY, where X and Y are the number of rows and columns (respectively)
  and are integers between the total number of players and 25.
  Example: 8x8
preload grid
  Which programs should be placed on the Grid at the start of the game.
  Value: a list of Programs, comma-separated.
  Example: GridCloakII, SectorReboot, BirdsEye
preload hackers
  Which programs every Hacker should have at the start of the game.
  Value: same syntax as preload-grid, but Programs must have flag PERS.
  Example: GridCloak
disable
  Which programs will never appear on the Grid.
  Value: same syntax as "preload grid".
interval
  How often a Program will be dropped on the Grid.
  Value: a nonzero positive integer. Example: 3 (this will cause a Program to
  drop after every third turn)


6. FLAGS


Flags modify the behavior of programs.

1SHOT
  One-shot. The Program will take input when it is obtained and then immediately
  self-destruct after it has served its purpose.
ONDEM
  On Demand. The Program can be used whenever the Hacker desires as a substitute
  for using "goto". It will announce when it is used.
PERS
  Persistent. The Program will remain in the background until it deletes itself,
  if such a thing ever happens. It may alter the game while it is running.
NORM
  Normal. The Program appears as often as any other.
RARE
  Rare. The Program does not appear often (half as often as most).
VRARE
  Very Rare. The Program hardly ever appears (one tenth as often as most).


7. PROGRAMS


By default, when a Hacker acquires a Program, both the Hacker and the name of
the acquired Program will be announced. This behavior can be changed via flags,
which are listed underneath each program's description.

GridCloak
  Prevents a Hacker from being Ejected by the SysOp if they move into a hole.
  Can only be used once.
  PERS  NORM
GridCloakII
  Same as GridCloak, but does not announce the hole location.
  PERS  RARE
Peekaboo
  Reveals the chosen coordinate of a Rival.
  1SHOT NORM
PeekabooII
  Same as Peekaboo, but also reveals that coordinate of the Hacker to the Rival.
  1SHOT RARE
PeekabooIII
  Similar to Peekaboo. Announces the chosen coordinate of ALL Hackers.
  1SHOT VRARE
Rootkit
  Gives special Grid access to the Hacker. This pseudo-program is a dependency
  for a few other programs.
  PERS  RARE
Gotcha
  The Hacker can no longer be Hacked; if a Rival moves into their location, that
  Rival will be Hacked instead of the Hacker themself. Like GridCloak, it can
  only be used once.
  PERS  RARE
GotchaII
  Same as Gotcha, but can be used infinitely. Requires Rootkit.
  PERS  VRARE
P2PSnitch
  Reveals the exact location of a chosen Rival to the Hacker. Also reveals the
  Hacker's exact location to said Rival, unless the Hacker has Rootkit.
  1SHOT NORM
LineLeak
  Announces a coordinate of the Rival whose turn is next. The coordinate will be
  whatever the Rival changes on their next move.
  PERS  NORM
LineLeakII
  Same as LineLeak, but applies to ALL Rivals on their next turns, followed by
  the Hacker themself (unless they have Rootkit).
  PERS  RARE
SilverBullet
  Hacks a chosen Rival if the Hacker can correctly determine one of their
  coordinates. Announces that coordinate of the Hacker if they are incorrect.
  1SHOT NORM
SilverBulletII
  Similar to SilverBullet. Hacks ALL Hackers that are in a chosen coordinate.
  Announces the Hacker's location if nobody is Hacked.
  1SHOT RARE
SilverBulletIII
  Similar to SilverBulletII. Hacks ALL Rivals that are in either coordinate of a
  chosen location, including the Hacker themself (which implies that they should
  not choose a location in their own view). Ejects the Hacker if nobody is
  Hacked.
  1SHOT VRARE
SectorReboot
  Changes all holes and spaces that contain Programs within the Hacker's view to
  empty spaces.
  ONDEM NORM
GridReboot
  Similar to SectorReboot. Changes ALL holes and spaces that contain Programs
  to empty spaces.
  ONDEM VRARE
BirdsEye
  Reveals the locations of all Programs and holes within the Hacker's view.
  ONDEM NORM
BirdsEyeII
  Similar to BirdsEye. Announces the locations of ALL Programs, unless the
  Hacker has Rootkit, in which case it REVEALS them instead.
  ONDEM RARE
EagleEye
  Similar to BirdsEyeII. Announces every Hacker's location. Requires Rootkit.
  ONDEM VRARE
ESC
  Moves the Hacker to a random empty space. Their former location and an
  arbitrary coordinate of their new location are announced.
  ONDEM NORM
ESCII
  Similar to ESC. Moves the Hacker to a random space, acquiring any Program and
  Hacking any Rival on that space. No location is announced.
  ONDEM RARE
ChaoticCorruption
  A chosen percentage of random locations are changed to holes, removing any
  Programs and Ejecting any Hackers on those locations.
  1SHOT VRARE
Tangelo
  Changes ALL free spaces to holes. This is bad. Requires Rootkit.
  1SHOT VRARE
BlindFold
  Prevents each Rival from being able to see their view for one turn.
  PERS  NORM
Shroomz
  Causes each Rival to see the Hacker in an arbitrary coordinate for one turn.
  PERS  NORM
ShroomzII
  Similar to Shroomz. The Hacker chooses a Rival that all other Rivals will see
  in an arbitrary coordinate for one turn. The chosen Rival will see the Hacker
  as if they were affected by Shroomz.
  PERS  RARE
TimeWarp
  Gives the Hacker another turn immediately.
  1SHOT NORM
TimeWarpII
  Similar to Timewarp. Allows the Hacker to take as many turns as they want, but
  they will not be able to see where they are going. Landing on a Hacker, hole,
  or another program stops the Hacker.
  1SHOT VRARE
Dynamite
  Changes every location in a chosen coordinate of the Hacker's view to holes,
  removing Programs and Ejecting Rivals in the path. The Hacker themself is
  left unaffected.
  1SHOT NORM
DoubleDynamite
  Same as Dynamite, but both coordinates are affected. The Hacker is given
  GridCloakII immediately afterwards (as there are no longer any spaces for them
  to move into).
  1SHOT VRARE
IronBoots
  On the Hacker's next turn, they will touch each location between their present
  one and the target location. Programs are not collected on the way, but Rivals
  are Hacked and holes can be fallen through.
  PERS  RARE
CrashLanding
  When obtained, the four squares adjacent to this program are turned to holes,
  Ejecting any Rivals.
  1SHOT NORM
CrashLandingII
  Same as CrashLanding, but the four squares diagonally touching the program's
  location are also affected for a total of eight squares turned to holes.
  1SHOT RARE
Bifurcator
  Enhances the Hacker's view, allowing them to see left, right, up, and down
  separately, instead of seeing left-right and up-down together.
  PERS  RARE
